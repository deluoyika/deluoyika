Python
Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose, dynamically typed programming language

It is also Object oriented, modular oriented and a scripting language.

In Python, everything is considered as an Object.

A python file has an extension of .py

Python follows Indentation to separate code blocks instead of flower brackets({}).

We can run a python file by the following command in cmd(Windows) or shell(mac/linux).

$ python <filename.py> or $ python3 <filename.py>

By default, python doesn't require any imports to run a python file.
